## JAVA PRACTICE REPOSITORY

### BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT JAVA:-

### 1. Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

### 2. What will I get when I download Java software from java.com?
#### The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 8 is what you get when you download Java software from java.com. The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting Java platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you need to run Java WebStart applications from a supported web browser. It doesn’t come with development tools, though – these tools are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

### 3. What is Java Plug-in software?
#### The Java Plug-in software is a component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE allows some applications written in the Java programming language to launch #### via some browsers. The Java Plug-in software is not a standalone program and cannot be installed separately.

### 4. I have heard the terms Java Virtual Machine and JVM. Is this Java software?
#### The Java Virtual Machine is only one part of Java software that is involved in running an application. The Java Virtual Machine is built right into your Java    software download, part of the JRE and helps run Java applications.
